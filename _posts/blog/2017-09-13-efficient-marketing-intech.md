If you are into open source and a bit of a neophiliac when it comes to discovering new software, chances are you have read something akin to the following statements etched proudly at the top of some project's README on GitHub:

> Yo! X helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments, and are easy to test. It is fast, simple, reliable with zero-overhead production readiness and nada ceremony.

You know why?

Because sometimes people wake up in the morning and ask themselves: "What shall I do today? Oh, I know! I shall design a framework that forces applications to behave terribly inconsistent and of course, they must all run in the same exact environment down to the kilobyte level. Not only the application must be crap to test but it must be slow, Lost-The-TV-Show-level convoluted with so much overhead that once you're done with production, you will yourself wholeheartedly finance a "Thank the Gods for we are forever done with this junk" ceremony.

Yes. Yes. That happens, which is why projects need to explicitly state the obvious opposite.

Seriously[?],
