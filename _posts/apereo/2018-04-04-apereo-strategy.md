# Feedback on Apereo strategy: focus on revenue to achieve sustainability

TL;DR: **Emphatically focus on recurring revenue to achieve sustainability.
Aggressively defer everything not focused upon this.**

## Context

+ [Apereo strategic plan][draft strategic plan]
+ Apereo [failed to secure enough recurring revenue][sakai-pmc 2018-03-09] to
  retain a full-time position supporting Sakai (Sakai-specific funding) and more
  generally roughly broke even on recurring membership revenue.

## Vision

(what future state are we trying to bring about?)

TL;DR: **Most higher education institutions will collaboratively develop,
maintain, and locally implement free and open source software solutions meeting
its needs, at all scales, and in all ways, doing this through and facilitated by
Apereo.**

Unpacking this:

**Higher education will collaboratively develop, maintain, and locally implement
free and open source software solutions meeting the needs of higher education.**
These will be directly valuable (delivering effective user experiences to higher
education constituents is awesome) and will be indirectly valuable in the
pitfalls they avoid, the choices they afford, and the effect they have on the
proprietary software offered to higher education through inspiration and through
competition.

Higher education will do this **at all scales**, for example both at the handy
little WordPress plug in end of things and the comprehensive lecture capture
solution or learning management system or ERP end of things.

Higher education will do this **in all ways**, and notably, **not just through
coding.** The activities of collaboration and maintenance of effective free and
open source software solutions meeting the needs of higher education are so very
much more than just coding or even of developing novel software solutions.
There's value in communities of practice, in context for understanding
higher-education-specific perspectives on more general open source software
solutions, in exerting higher-education-serving influences on open source
software projects with wider contexts beyond higher education.

To give an example: apparently
[WordPress powers more than 30% of the Web][WordPress features],
including a great many sites in and around higher education. Higher education
doesn't need its own WordPress-like thing. But higher education may very well
have particular needs for plugins for WordPress, for ways of using WordPress,
for problems to solve with WordPress, for experiences to share. There's a there
there in the "in higher education" part of "Using WordPress in higher
education". Higher education might particularly need WordPress plugins to
fulfill accessibility and usability expectations, and might particularly need
clarity about what WordPress implementation choices are and are not consistent
with higher education's especial needs to provide accessibility. There's
worthwhile work to be done and insights to share to facilitate higher education
success in leveraging WordPress.

**Apereo will be the organization that enables higher education to succeed at
this collaborative development, maintenance, and local implementation**. Apereo
will be the context for this work, particularly facilitating the
cross-institutional aspects of this and the natural handoff of participation
from institutions to institutions as time and circumstances evolve. Apereo will
deliver identifiable value to higher education, value to any given member
institution in excess of the membership fees borne by that institution.

To give an example: Sakai is a free and open source by for and about higher
education learning management system. Such a thing should very much exist and be
a viable option. It does and is. Sakai deserves significant sustaining
resources. The preeminent actually open source learning management system for
higher education ought to be tremendously supported. Apereo qua Apereo should be
adding lots of value to this.

**Most higher education institutions will be Apereo members, because most higher
education institutions will be (already are) making significant use of free and
open source software solutions** and that use will be more effective and more
confident because of the value Apereo is adding to it. If they're not using
Sakai as a learning management system or OpenCast for lecture capture or an open
source ERP, they're most certainly using WordPress or Drupal somewhere or are
generating and transforming CSV files representing institutional data or
integrating across SaaS vendor products or educators are using open source text
editors to author lesson plans or... There's tremendous breadth of
opportunity for higher education to benefit from open source, so there's
tremendous breadth of opportunity for Apereo to add value to higher education's
benefiting from open source.

**Strategy:**

(how are we going to get to achieve this vision?)

First and foremost, **Apereo must achieve critical mass of recurring revenues
(membership fees) to achieve sustainability.**

There are all sorts of opportunities to add value to collaborative open source
in higher education. But to meaningfully pursue these, to meaningfully impact
the world over the longer term, Apereo needs to exist with enough substance to
be able to, well, do things. The thing about unsustainable things is that
they're really hard to sustain. Working towards the vision will require
sustained effort for many years (forever?) and so achieving sustainability is
essential.

So here's the strategy:

1. Increase revenue
2. Use all available resources, including revenue, to further increase revenue.
3. Increase revenue
4. Apply staff and other efforts to provide members a
   positive return on their membership investment. Apereo must deliver
   recognizable value to the members, value enough that the members are saying
   "Sure am happy to be paying for that membership, because we're clearly
   getting more out of Apereo than we're paying into it." This will stabilize
   and retain revenue.
5. Increase revenue through the increased memberships as more and more of higher
   education sees Apereo as a source of value very much worth sustaining.
6. Increase revenue through (carefully targeted?) increased membership fees as
   more Apereo members are realizing more value from their Apereo membership.
7. Use the increased revenue to add more value to higher education. Use the
   increased value to higher education to secure more revenue. Repeat until the
   vision is achieved (in practice, forever).

The most important challenge here is that at the early end of this strategy
Apereo is adding less value to higher education and so revenue, in the form of
memberships, are harder to secure, whereas at the later end of this strategy
Apereo is adding more value to higher education and so revenue, in the form of
memberships, is easier to secure.

**The most existential risk is in the early phases.**

**So the thing to do is to focus on escaping the early phases.**

So here's what this strategy means:

**Focus entirely on things that will increase revenue (membership). Defer
everything that won't affect revenue (membership).**

Considering incubating a new open source software project? Is that project going
to bring in more membership revenue? Yes? Pull it in. No? Hold off.

Having a presence anywhere? Is that presence going to bring in more members, or
is it necessary to retain existing members? No? Don't go.

Is securing ICLAs going to bring in new or retain members? Great, do it, more
members are absolutely essential to sustainability. It's not going to impact
membership? Suspend the whole program.

Is re-licensing a project from a New BSD license to an Apache2 license going to
bring in more members, or is it necessary to retain existing members? Yes?
Great, undertake that hassle. No? Defer it.

Considering a partnership? Neat. Will it increase recurring membership revenue?
Go for it. It won't? It's a distraction, defer it.

Apereo cannot afford to do anything that isn't increasing recurring revenue.
Doing anything that isn't increasing recurring revenue has the opportunity cost
of *not* doing something more likely to increase revenue. Intentionally
navigating these tradeoffs is essential to maximizing Apereo's odds of having
a meaningful influence a decade from now.

**This is painful. Opportunities that by other measures would be worthwhile must
be foregone. But this is how to get to sustainability, and without
sustainability, nothing else Apereo does is going to matter much over the long
term.**

**The idea isn't to *never* do anything other than pursue recurring revenue. The
idea is prioritize pursuing recurring revenue until recurring revenue is
sufficient to afford the luxury of applying resources to pursue the
organizational mission.**

## Feedback on Apereo draft

With this vision (higher education succeeding wildly by collaboratively meeting
its needs through free and open source software) and strategy (achieve critical
mass to enable Apereo adding value and doing so sustainably) in mind, here's my
feedback on Apereo's draft strategic themes:

### 1. Membership, Financial Health and Fundraising

> In 2018 Apereo will focus on recruiting adopters of Apereo software and other
> educational and commercial organisations into an expanded foundation
> membership.

Yes, do that. All of higher education should be Apereo members. Get far enough
towards that to achieve sustainability.

Consider reviving the individual membership program.

Consider ways to price discriminate so that institutions that can pay more do.

### 2. Foundation Services & New Ideas

> 2018 will see a review of key Apereo services to support the community,
> together with the elaboration of a process for introducing new services and
> areas of activity, and reviewing - and potentially retiring old ones.

If adding a service will yield more members or is necessary to retain members,
do it.

If it won't affect membership, defer it or suspend it.

One kind of service that might widen memberships are those that affect breadth.
A better implementation of more active discussion lists or chat might enable
Apereo to widen scope into e.g. higher education knowledge sharing around
WordPress plugins. Become the place for higher education to talk WordPress, to
collaborate, to share -- and maybe Apereo could reach 500 more people across 100
more institutions. Pull in 10% of those institutions as members and maybe we're
getting somewhere.

Curtail services offered to non-members who aren't going to become members.

Look for opportunities to expand into spaces and activities that will increase
membership with low or no additional infrastructure and services commitments.

Job posting board reserved for members? Maybe members would value being able to
post opportunities (presumably, about working with open source for the
institution) to a context that reaches IT professionals likely to have
experience with higher education and with open source?

Speakers or consultants directory? Maybe members would value more ready leads on
expertise about open source in higher education.

Institutional project matching service? Maybe members would value leads on what
others have experienced with specific open source technologies or attempting to
leverage open source for specific kinds of projects.

*These may be terrible ideas.* The lens for evaluating them is whether they will
retain and increase membership revenue.

### 3. Software Community Health

> Apereo will explore the potential for a light-touch framework for expressing
and communicating the health of constituent software communities during the
course of 2018, as a contribution to greater transparency and adoption.

This doesn't sound like it will attract or retain membership revenues. If this
isn't going to bring in more members and it's not essential to retain existing
members, defer it.

Apereo just can't afford this. The constituent software communities are however
healthy they are. They'll do what they can do, or not, to determine and
communicate health. There are
[some badging, checklisting, health assessing efforts afoot][open 2018-03-08]
more generally in open source. That'll have to be good enough.

### 4. Communications, Outreach and Engagement

> Apereo will expand its communications efforts across three principle audience
> axes  - specific to role (CIO, Faculty, Learning Technologist, Student,
> Researcher), to interest area (specific software, theme or topic), and
> geographical region or country.

Cut this down to only the communication efforts that will attract and retain
members. That probably means focusing on helping CIOs to see value and urgency
in Apereo membership, maybe targeting institutions that have already adopted
Apereo software significantly (so, most likely to care) and in regions likely to
be able to afford an Apereo membership (so, more likely to impact overall
revenue more).

It's not that other kinds of communication aren't valuable. It's that Apereo
can't afford it until it can.

> Above-campus or cloud-based service provision, and its interaction with open
> source software, is a theme of specific interest that will be assigned
> priority in the coming year, particularly in terms of approaches taken in
> different parts of the world.

If there's any way to defer this, defer it. It sounds like a distraction from
securing memberships.

 > Communications and outreach is a critical enabler of objectives around
 > membership and financial health. In particular community members will be
 > encouraged and equipped to represent their engagement in Apereo activities,
 > and use of Apereo software, as they engage with other associations they are
 > active within - EDUCAUSE, AXIES, ALT etc.

This sounds promising.

 > The Foundation will continue to support a range of global, regional and
 > individual software community events over the course of the coming year,
 > seeking economies of scale by combination or linkage where appropriate, and
 > working with partner organisations to increase effectiveness and reduce
 > costs.

Do as little of this as Apereo can get away with and leverage it as much as
possible to draw in more members and retain existing members.

### 5. Partnerships

> Apereo will continue to seek partnerships with organisations with missions
that overlap its own, or are complimentary.

Pursue new and invest in existing partnerships only insofar as these will pull
in more members and retain existing members.

Consider reworking existing partnerships. For example, every French university
should be an Apereo member. Apereo cannot afford to forgo this revenue, and
ESUP cannot afford *not* to support Apereo in this way over the longer term in
order to make the open source software ESUP relies upon more sustainable.

 > We will act to promote LAMP as a solution for smaller institutions, and
 > deepen our collaboration with ESUP-Portail, as it continues to grow the
 > adoption of, and contribution to, an increasing range of Apereo software in
 > France.

Only do this if it's going to increase membership. Investing in LAMP and ESUP
should be through the lens of expected recurring revenue returns on that
investment.

### 6. Development Opportunities and Recognition Programs

> It is appropriate that we review progress so far to encourage and resource
> further development, and additional strands of these \[recognition]
> activities. 2018 will also see the exploration of a series of developmental
> activities for Apereo community participants, beginning to unlock the
> potential for further sharing of expertise across the broad community.

Apereo can't afford this. I imagine no institution became or remained a member
because of an Apereo fellowship or an ATLAS award. (The Fellowship program in
particular seems to have an interesting track record of fellows exiting Apereo
contexts soon after their fellowship).
