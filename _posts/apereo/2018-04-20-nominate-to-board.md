title:      Nominate awesome fits for the Apereo board
summary:    Provoking thoughts about who might serve well on Apereo board.
tags:       [Apereo]

Are you a
[representative of a Member Organization in good standing][bylaws 5]
contemplating whom to nominate for the
[available Apereo board of directors seats][call for nominees]?

Here are some ideas. Until 1700 Eastern on April 20th 2018, it's not too late to
widen the pool.

(I haven't checked with most people listed here to see if they'd actually be
willing to serve - the point of this post is to provoke thought on who *you*
would like to see serving on this board and *why*, thoughts on what
characteristics would make for excellent board leadership and round out the
perspectives available in Apereo.)

(As often I speak here only wearing my individual contributor hat.)

## Vicky Brasseur

With experience serving on the Open Source Initiative board, as an author and
moderator on opensource.com, and as a professional software engineer, Vicky
would be a valuable voice on the Apereo Board.

Vicky has literally written the
[book on contributing to open source software][fyfwos].

If Apereo can't draw in Vicky's attentions gratis through board service, I
advocate Apereo hiring Vicky's significant expertise through her
[consulting services](https://www.vmbrasseur.com/services/).

## Audrey Watters

[Audrey][audreywatters] is a very important voice of EdTech skepticism. It would
be helpful to have her at the table.

## Karen Sandler

[Karen](https://sfconservancy.org/about/staff/#karen) is executive director of
the Software Freedom Conservancy.

Karen would bring

+ legal experience, including with the [Conservancy's perspective][sfc iclas] on
  the necessity of ICLAs
+ experience directing a non-profit foundation with an annual budget on the same
  order of magnitude as Apereo
+ experience in diversity and inclusion especially through her Outreachy work

Apereo might learn much from Conservancy perspective.

## Tim Vertein

My colleague Tim is a thoughtful, productive, effective professional
with a proven commitment to the university and to serving university
participants well. He'd make a great Apereo Board director for many of the same
reasons [he'd make a great Apereo fellow][tim vertein fellow nomination].

## Misagh Moayyed

Misagh is the Apereo CAS project PMC chair.

I think Apereo at the Board level has unrealized opportunity to better consider
the perspective and experiences of the people working in Apereo projects. The
disconnect between (relatively closed) Board governance and "100% open" projects
might be alleviated through bringing those perspectives closer to the
governance.

Misagh has distinguished himself through thoughtful
stewardship of the Apereo CAS project, one of the more successful Apereo
projects in breadth of adoption, quantity of contributors, and in engineering
attention to enabling divergent local configuration of a shared open source
software product.

## Shane Curcuru

Apereo sometimes tries to take Apache's lead and presumably could do so even
better informed by a board director who has experience and achievement
in the Apache Software Foundation context, evident from Apache committership,
Apache PMC membership, Apache Board Director experience, and Apache Foundation
Membership.

([Membership in the Apache Software Foundation][Apache members] is a big deal.
You can't buy it.)

> Membership in The Apache Software Foundation is a privilege and is by
> invitation only.

Shane specifically has experience with Apache incubation and community
development, both especially relevant to Apereo's challenges.

If Apereo can't draw in Shane's attentions gratis through Board service, I
advocate Apereo hiring Shane's significant expertise under the auspices of his
open source community engagement consultancy, [Punderthings Consulting][].

## Pat Masson

[Pat](https://opensource.org/docs/board-annotated#PatrickMasson) is General
Manager of the Open Source Initiative.

Pat has experience with higher education and particularly with Apereo.

The OSI's experience is also relevant in that it has a successful individual
membership program. As Apereo bootstraps its own individual membership program
OSI's experience might help catapault this to sustainability.

## Ben Balter

Ben is a lawyer with an important perspective on
[tradeoffs in contributor license agreement rigor][ben balter no cla]. Also,
Ben's experience in federal government service might be a helpful public service
perspective on the board.

## Tim Carroll

Tim is a current Apereo board member whose term is ending and who is available
for re-nomination.

It might be a fine thing to re-nominate Tim. He seems a voice of pragmatism on
the board.

On the public record, Tim

+ shared [an article on the open@ list](https://groups.google.com/a/apereo.org/d/topic/open/Xtdt2I8VMQQ/discussion)
+ [engaged](https://groups.google.com/a/apereo.org/d/msg/licensing-discuss/c1puG3RKZcA/nPDMUCU6EAAJ)
  regarding the failed 2016 attempt to unburden Apereo ICLA policy. (I wish that
  had succeeded, but engagement was still better than not engaging with the
  issue).
+ [engaged](https://groups.google.com/a/apereo.org/d/msg/open/GNtB1MGvZK4/rebkAZPSBwAJ)
  regarding a proposal to create an open parallel to the closed `projects@`
  email list (advocating using existing `open@` for this purpose)
+ [voiced a way to un-stick a potential incubation](https://groups.google.com/a/apereo.org/d/msg/incubation/86VDDg_ADZI/IvFNEKSZBQAJ)

Of the 8 Apereo board meetings in the past year for which [minutes][]
are available, 6 show Tim as attending (75%).

## Charles Severance

Dr. Chuck is the Apereo Sakai project PMC chair. He also has experience serving
as an Executive Director of an open source foundation and as a board member.
This combination of executive, governance, and
working-in-the-open-source-project perspectives could be highly valuable on the
board.

## Bryan Ollendyke

[Bryan](https://www.drupal.org/u/btopro) is tremendously passionate about this,
about openness and about improving higher education and about the quality of
community interactions. Bryan's work is well-regarded.

The energy, passion, sense of urgency, and bias for action he brings might in
itself make his board term very worthwhile.

## A registrar

Apereo ought to be adding tremendous value to the work of university registrars.
What are the not-yet-realized opportunities in this space and would bringing a
registrar's perspective closer to the governance help?

## Another CIO

Apereo ought to be adding tremendous value and leverage to the work of
university CIOs, broadening the viable tactical and strategic options and having
the side effect of pressuring proprietary and SaaS vendors to better serve
education (out of a healthy concern about the alternatives available to
universities). What are the not-yet-realized opportunities in this space and
would bringing another CIO's perspective closer to the governance help to
realize those opportunties?

## Apereo Fellows

I'd expect any of the [Apereo Fellows][] would bring an informed perspective to
the board.

## Others

What experiences and perspectives would you like to see more of on the Apereo
board? Who might bring those to bear? Is there an opportunity for that to
happen?
