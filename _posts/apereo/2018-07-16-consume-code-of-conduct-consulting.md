# Apereo should consume some code of conduct consulting

## Potential in code of conduct consulting

+ Achieving diversity and inclusion is the **right thing to do**. Preventing,
  handling, and demonstrating preparedness to handle harassment is the right
  thing to do.
+ Achieving diversity and inclusion is the **competitive thing to do**. Goodness
  knows Apereo and its projects need more and more active participants.
  Achieving the full potential for drawing in participation will necessarily
  involve drawing from a diverse pool and being especially inclusive.
+ There's **domain expertise** to be brought to bear. (There's opportunity for a
  consultant to make a difference).
+ It's easy to get codes of conduct wrong. (There's **risk** to mitigate).
+ Excellence in diversity and inclusion can draw in more and deeper
  contribution. (There's advantage to seek).
+ Apereo has a **problematic history** with its welcoming policy. (There's more
  than usual opportunity to pay down culture and process debt).

## Who might consult

+ Audrey Eschright, who
  [offers a fixed price ($200) code of conduct checkup][audrey prix fix]
  that might be a good fit for Apereo getting started. I expect her
  [deeper consulting offerings][audrey deeper] would be necessary, but maybe the
  most important thing about getting help is to start getting it and the fixed
  price offering might be just the thing to get off the ground on this.
+ Sage Sharp via Otter Tech offers
  [training on code of conduct incident response][otter tech response training]
  specifically and
  [diversity and inclusion consulting][otter tech d and i consulting] more
  generally
+ Others?

## What to consult about

A suitable diversity and inclusion consultant will come to the
consultation with experience and perspective on what needs looking at.

### The policy itself

The [welcoming policy][] itself:

+ How and why does it differ from other organizations' and projects' codes of
  conduct?
+ Why isn't it literally the [Contributor Covenant][], and what tradeoffs are
  navigated in that difference?

### The resources available to Apereo around diversity and inclusion

The [Board is working as hard and as fast as it can][Board working fast as can],
so maybe there's not a lot of opportunity to work harder and faster with
existing resources.

So how might Apereo bring more expertise to bear to get better levereage out of
the available volunteer and staff efforts?

### The operationalization of the welcoming policy

+ How operationally ready is Apereo to receive and handle a complaint under the
  policy?
+ What might be done to make Apereo more ready and more confident in this?

### The diversity and inclusion aspects of the by-laws

The "exception" in [bylaws][] appendix E.B.2-3 gives me the heebie jeebies:

> The Apereo Foundation, and all projects under its "umbrella," are open to all
> people regardless of race, creed, age, nationality, culture, political
> affiliation and beliefs, gender, sexuality, etc. (cf. Apereo Welcoming
> Policy).
> Exception: Apereo is an International organization with events spanning the
> globe. Participants in activities that are not in their home country and/or
> culture should expect to conform to the culture and mores of the location of
> the event.

There are at least 2 things bothering me about this.

One is **political affiliation and beliefs being listed as protected classes**
alongside race, gender, and sexuality, and the nod to the Apereo Welcoming
Policy in that recitation.

The Apereo Welcoming Policy *doesn't* explicitly protect political affiliation
and beliefs; it might be problematic to gloss that it does. Cf. the
[recent OSCON controversy on a similar point][coraline no oscon].

There is, at the least, something important and nuanced to be understood and
navigated about the relationship of openness and welcoming to being open to
*all* political beliefs. There are a lot of political beliefs and affiliations
in the world, some of which not so very welcoming of others based on race,
gender, sexuality, national origin, etc.

Another is that this literally reads as

> ... open to all people regardless of race, ... exceptions

which suggests that Apereo might countenance exceptions to the Foundation and
its projects being open to all people regardless of race.

You know that thing where people say "I'm not a racist but..."? How many
sentences that start that way don't end up sounding pretty much, well, racist?

Maybe there's something important this policy is trying to say that could be
said in a way that doesn't on close read sound like there might be an
"exception" to prohibiting racism.

Perhaps a diversity and inclusion
consultant could offer some perspective on how that bylaw relates to how other
organizations navigate these issues and on best practices for navigating the
issues.

Could help Apereo consider whether and what to learn from the OSCON experience
on this point of political affiliations and beliefs as protected class.
