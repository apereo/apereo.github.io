[Apereo's 2017-2018 annual report][]
includes a section on uPortal, based on
[some notes][notes for uPortal section of annual report]
the uPortal community
[put together][thread soliciting uPortal report inputs].

This post works from that content, evolving towards a more free-standing yet
hyperlinked read.

uPortal continues to lead as an open source enterprise portal solution built by
and for higher education.

## Calls to action

+ Join [uPortal's Supporting Subscription program][uportal-supporting-subscription-model].
+ Propose projects into the new [uPortal Ecosystem Intake Process][].
+ Directly participate in uPortal.
+ Engage in Apereo.
+ Become an [individual Apereo member][Apereo individual membership].

(These calls to action are re-stated with supporting detail in the conclusion.)

## Summary

(The year described herein is 2017-05-01 through 2018-04-30).

+ Growth: Growth of the uPortal-as-ecosystem idiom, with a clarified
  [Intake Process][uPortal Ecosystem Intake Process], the
  [`uPortal-home`][uPortal-home]
  software product successfully graduating from Apereo Incubation,
  and 4 new software products entering the ecosystem.
+ Life: Almost 100 versioned releases of uPortal ecosystem software products.
+ Particpation: 7 new core contributors, 1 new core committer, calls, meetups,
  presentations, and list discussions, oh my.
+ Financial responsibility: $26,000 recurring revenue with a $51,000 fund
  balance.
+ Hope: to increase recurring revenue to sustainably fund a stream of effort
  transforming individual and institutional return-on-investment on uPortal
  participation and thereby encouraging a virtuous cycle towards more
  investment with better ROI encouraging more investment yielding better returns
  encouraging more investment yielding...

## Ecosystem

A variety of software products complement the core platform to make up the
greater uPortal ecosystem. uPortal further developed the ecosystem idiom this
year, introducing a more formal [uPortal Ecosystem Intake Process][] clarifying
how to recognize projects as part of the ecosystem, ideally starting
collaboration and openness at a very early stage in these ancillary software
product initiatives.

The ecosystem grew with 1 project successfully exiting Apereo Incubation
([`uPortal-home`][uPortal-home]) and 4 new projects entering the ecosystem via
the new Intake Process:

+ `ESUP-filemanager`
+ `Soffit-kotlin-example`
+ `uPortal-setup-scripts`
+ `uPortal-web-components`

A new `uPortal-contrib` Github organization hosts projects upon intake.

## Releases

The project continues to show healthy activity, with almost 100 versioned
releases of software products within the ecosystem.

Counting core, intook, and incubating software products ("software products in
the uPortal ecosystem"), and *not* counting open source software products in the
neighborhood but not formally part of the ecosystem: **97 total releases**.

### uPortal core releases

+ 22 releases
+ (1 major, 7 patch, 1 release candidate, and 13 milestones)

### Alternative user interfaces

+ [`uPortal-home`][uPortal-home]: 13 releases (2 major, 6 minor, 5 patch)
+ `uPortal-app-framework`: 16 releases (5 major, 5 minor, 6 patch)


### Portlet releases

9 Portlet software products saw at least one release, with 36 total releases.

+ `AnnouncementsPortlet`: 10 releases. (1 minor, 9 patch)
+ `CalendarPortlet`: 4 releases. (1 minor, 3 patch)
+ `FeedbackPortlet`: 3 releases (1 minor, 2 patch)
+ `JasigWidgetPortlets`: 1 minor release.
+ `NewsReaderPortlet`: 7 releases. (1 major, 1 minor, 5 patch)
+ `NotificationPortlet`: 6 releases. (2 minor, 4 patch)
+ `SimpleContentPortlet`: 6 releases. (1 major, 3 minor, 2 patch)
+ `WeatherPortlet`: 2 patch releases.
+ `WebProxyPortlet`: 2 patch releases.

### Supporting software products

+ Resource-server: 5 releases (2 minor, 3 patch)

## Participation

The core uPortal platform project added 1 new committer (Jim Helwig 2017-07-19)
and 7 new contributors,
with 18 total contributors. This year saw an increase in direct participation by
commmunity members in France, through submissions to the new Intake Process and
translations of documentation.

Contributors this year to core uPortal, new in bold:

+ Ludovic Auxepaules
+ **Chris Beach**
+ **Josh Brudnak**
+ **Colin Campbell**
+ Christian Cousquer
+ **Nisith Dash**
+ **Mairi Fraser**
+ Benito Gonzalez
+ **Allan Jackson**
+ **KaJuan Johnson**
+ Christian Murphy
+ Gary Roybal
+ Andrew Petro
+ Brandon Powell
+ Corey Rowe
+ Jonathan Tran
+ Timothy Vertein
+ Drew Wills

(Note that this is counting committers and contributors in
*the core uPortal platform itself* and does not account for contributors and
committers in the other ecosystem projects.)

Public engagement opportunities included 5 calls or webinars, 2 in-person
meetups, 16 conference presentations, and over 1,000 discussion list posts.

Newly introduced shared Google Team Drives welcome collaboration and
sharing of artifacts in less source-code-centric ways. This tooling has already
proven conducive to sharing local user research findings from uPortal adopters.

uPortal handled one security vulnerability this year:

+ 2017-09-26: Feedback portlet injectable fixed in Feedback Portlet `1.2.1`.
  Aaron Grant, Drew Wills, and Christian Murphy filled roles in the security
  incident handling process.

## Financials

Institutions can sustain the project through the
[uPortal Supporting Subscription program][uportal-supporting-subscription-model],
a rider to the institutional Apereo membership.

uPortal added 1 subscriber to a total of 3 with annual revenue of $26,000 and a
fund balance of $51,000.

Current uPortal Supporting Subscribers:

+ University of Wisconsin-Madison (uPortal Champion)
+ Oakland University (uPortal Booster)
+ Brigham Young University (uPortal Friend)

Thusfar the project's strategy has been to avoid spending these funds in ad-hoc
ways, preferring to accumulate an asset balance and work towards a level of
recurring revenue that will enable this sustainable application of funds -- a
program with the recurring revenue to say fund and FTE and with a healthy asset
balance to cushion bumps might prove stable and stabilizing.

In the year to come, the project hopes to achieve reach a threshold level of
recurring revenue to enable the project to responsibly, sustainably convert
those funds into efforts advancing the project, driving down barriers to
adoption and participation and improving the institutional return-on-investment
in that participation.

Improve the return-on-investment and thereby attract more investment which will
create more opportunities to improve the return-on-investment and a virtuous
cycle ensues.

## Challenges and opportunities

### Apereo as CVE numbering authority

CVEs are prohibitively difficult to acquire. This limits effectiveness of
communication about security. Apereo becoming a CVE Numbering Authority could
reduce friction in and increase effectiveness of communication about security
vulnerabilities.

### Measuring and recruiting adopters

We do not have an effective way to measure adopters. There are doubtless
unrealized opportunities to draw in adopters as Apereo institutional members,
uPortal sustaining subscription subscribers, and most importantly as
collaborators in the uPortal ecosystem.

### Growing the uPortal ecosystem

The growth of the intake, contrib, ecosystem, and attic concepts and processes
sets the stage to more clearly welcome, characterize, collaborate within, and
communicate about projects in the uPortal ecosystem.

### Sustainably converting uPortal Supporting Subscription revenue to forward progress

Hitting recurring revenue thresholds would unlock converting revenue to forward
progress yielding a return-on-investment for subscribers which might encourage
additional investment, a virtuous and sustainable cycle ensuing.

### Discourse as superior discussion forums solution

Discourse has been adopted elsewhere to positive effect and might do a lot of
good in uPortal and Apereo as well.

### Socialized and collaborate with other Apereo projects

uPortal and other Apereo projects might practice more and better collaboratively
rather than locally developing and maintaining project lifecycle, security
incident handling, communications, release engineering, and other processes and
practices within project siloes.

## Calls to action, reprise

+ uPortal adopting institutions, please
  **join [uPortal's Supporting Subscription program][[uportal-supporting-subscription-model]**.
  This rider to an institutional Apereo membership will build modest but
  essential recurring revenue for resourcing the uPortal project for confident
  sustainability. Begin this as modestly as your institution may need;
  every little bit will help this program hit the transformative threshold
  of potentially adding a full time staffer focused on carrying uPortal qua open
  source project forward. If your institution is already subscribing,
  find a way to dig deep and increase your commitment.
  **The opportunities for a more confident uPortal future are real.**
+ **Propose ancillary projects** (software products) into
  [uPortal's new Ecosystem Intake Process][uPortal Ecosystem Intake Process]. It
  has never been easier or clearer how to approach
  a tight, modular plug-in for use with uPortal (whether user-facing content,
  back-end service, or otherwise). The best time to begin openness and welcome
  involvement of the wider community is the moment you start. If you locally see
  a need, it's very likely that another adopter could learn from this, could
  collaborate with you upon it, or could adopt the add-on and likewise has
  locally developed add-ons that you could be adopting too to the advantage of
  all.
  **The opportunities for more and better collaboration are real.**
+ **Directly participate in uPortal.** It has never been easier to collaborate
  upon and
  contribute to uPortal, to its documentation, and to its ancillary projects.
  Suggesting an edit to even this "marketing-flavored" post is feasible via
  GitHub's tooling, directly in your Web browser.
  **The opportunities for collaboration are real, and are beyond code.**
+ **Engage in Apereo.** Ensure your institution is an institutional member of
  Apereo and have an active relationship with your institutional representative.
  **The opportunities for participation in all things Apereo are real.**
+ **Become an [individual Apereo member][Apereo individual membership].**
  Apereo's membership model is no longer
  solely that of higher education institutions as members -- you as an
  individual human being can be a member and will gain a vote for a Foundation
  Board seat.
  **The opportunities to be at the table in more interesting ways are real.**
