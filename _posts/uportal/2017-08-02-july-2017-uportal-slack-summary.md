In July 2017, 5 people participated substantially in conversation in the [slack.apereo.org #uportal channel]. (This is around half as many participants as in June.)

+ Andrew Petro
+ Benito Gonzalez
+ Christian Murphy
+ Drew Wills
+ KaJuan Johnson

Conversation highlights include:

+ Christian expressing interest in the new GitHub feature around CODEOWNERS files automating suggested code reviewers. ([uportal-dev thread](https://groups.google.com/a/apereo.org/d/topic/uportal-dev/-GZrLbjcM7A/discussion)).
+ Drew expressing excitement about [a Pull Pequest removing Ant and Maven from the uPortal-start build](https://github.com/Jasig/uPortal-start/pull/21). ([uportal-dev@ thread](https://groups.google.com/a/apereo.org/d/topic/uportal-dev/W0T9MSRpfNw/discussion))
+ KaJuan asking about filtering and placeholder replacement in Gradle.
+ Christian expressing excitement about [a Pull Request cleaning up uPortal's Gradle build](https://github.com/Jasig/uPortal/pull/937)
+ Christian asking that the Coveralls status reports for uPortal PRs be switched back on.
+ Christian asking about `uPortal-developer` GitHub team access to a couple specific repos.
+ A branch of conversation about Apereo needing something like [the Apache Attic](https://attic.apache.org/)
+ A branch of conversation with the insight that if we want to emulate Apache, maybe we should just do more of our work directly in an Apache Software Foundation context.
+ Love for the now active [Apereo uPortal Twitter account](https://twitter.com/uPortal) and exploring updating its avatar image.

## On Slack

I have [concerns about the openness properties of Slack as implemented by Apereo][open@ 2017-06-15]. You can't access it or read its logs anonymously; it's not Google search indexed. Past ten thousand messages back, messages aren't available even if you log in.

Summarizing the conversations in this anonymously, publicly accessible, and Google indexable context somewhat mitigates these problems. But not necessarily other problems that make [email list communications preferable in open source projects].

Arguably, all of the conversations held in the `#uportal` Slack channel this month could have been held via email on `uportal-dev@` or `uportal-user@` email lists additionally or instead. Some relevant email list threads are linked above.
