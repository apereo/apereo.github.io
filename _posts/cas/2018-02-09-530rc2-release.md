## Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). In order to start experimenting with release candidates, use the following strategies.

At any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Apache Maven

In the `pom.xml` of the overlay, adjust the following tag to match below:

```xml
<cas.version>5.3.0-RC2</cas.version>
```

### Gradle

In the `gradle.properties` of the overlay, adjust the following setting to match below:

```properties
cas.version=5.3.0-RC2
```

## Minors

6. Thanks to [@leleuj](https://github.com/leleuj), better error handling is put in place for email notifications specially when no principal attribute is found to indicate the target email address.
7. The DynamoDb table name used to [hold CAS' registered service definitions](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/DynamoDb-Service-Management.html) can now be customized via CAS settings.
8. The logout webflow/view is now able to correctly recognize and activate the required code snippet for Google Analytics.
9. Thanks to [@marqc](https://github.com/marqc),the condition that controls the issuing of ticket-granting tickets is improved to take into account identical usernames found in multiple account sources.
10. Thanks to [@johnlister](https://github.com/johnlister), better error handling is put in place during the password management reset flows when an invalid username is provided.
11. Thanks to [@plajko](https://github.com/plajko), ordering of the authentication handlers selected for the current transaction is correctly enforced.
12. Thanks to [@deel77](https://github.com/deel77), the Slovak language bundles are updated.

20. Thanks to [@hdeadman](https://github.com/hdeadman), the SSL valve for the embedded Apache Tomcat is now correctly registered with the servlet container. 

## Hazelcast Discovery

CAS is now able to leverage Apache jclouds and Microsoft Azure, when it comes to [Hazelcast and auto-discovery](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Hazelcast-Ticket-Registry.html).

## Apache Syncope Authentication

As yet another method of authentication, CAS is now able to [leverage Apache Syncope](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Syncope-Authentication.html) to locate user accounts.

## Operation Lombok

CAS begins to adopt [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org) in order to reduce noise and boilerplate code used to obtain logger objects, generate getter/setter methods, etc. This is part of a bigger gradual step at possibly converting the codebase relevant modules over to Kotlin to further improve readability and reduce LOC.

Before the migration, total number of lines for Java classes stood at `207,002`. Today, after the migration the number of lines is reduced down to `109,398`.

## HTTP Security Headers per Service

Injection of HTTP security headers into the response can now be controlled on a per-service basis. See [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Service-Http-Security-Headers.html) for more info.

## Registered Services REST API

For some time, CAS has had support for a [REST-like API allowing one to add service definitions](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/protocol/REST-Protocol.html) into the registry. This API was quite limited in accepting different properties of a given service definition or different types of services for various protocols. In this release candidate, this API is improved slightly to accept all types of service definitions in the API request body and making it slightly easier to execute such requests with proper authentication and authorization enforcements.

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Beware</strong><br/>This is a breaking change. Please revisit the API requests and reformulate them accordingly.
</div>

## SAML2 Service Providers

The following new SAML2 service providers are now supported by CAS out of the box:

- Amazon

## JSON Whitelist Authentication

 A [JSON-based authentication strategy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Whitelist-Authentication.html) is now included that allows one to mimic user account details, mostly useful for development and testing.

## REST Protocol Credential Extraction

The [CAS REST protocol](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/protocol/REST-Protocol.html) in this release candidate is given the ability to extract multiple sets of credentials from the request body and prep them for authentication. In practice this means that various modules, such as [YubiKey](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/YubiKey-Authentication.html) and [Google Authenticator](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/GoogleAuthenticator-Authentication.html), may be allowed to insert a special credential extractor into the REST engine automatically when detected in order to let the REST request achieve MFA.

## AWS Credential Fetching

For components that tightly integrate with AWS such as [Cloud Directory Authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/AWS-CloudDirectory-Authentication.html) or [CloudWatch](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Logging-Cloudwatch.html), etc CAS is now given the ability to fetch credentials from a variety of sources as part of an ordered chain. Sources include system properties, environment variables, EC2 instance metadata, etc.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Beware</strong><br/>This is a breaking change. As part of this change, a number of module names for CloudWatch logging, etc have changed their names to belong to the <code>support</code> category of CAS modules rather than <code>core</code>. Review the documentation and adjust accordingly.
</div>

## Mapped Attribute Value Filters

A [new attribute value filter](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Value-Release-Policies.html#mutant-mapped-regex) is added whose main ability is to filter attribute values by a collection of patterns and then supplant the value dynamically based on the results of the regex match.

## Authenticate Credentials via REST Protocol

[A new REST endpoint](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/protocol/REST-Protocol.html#authenticate-credentials) is now exposed that is tasked to only verify the validity of the provided credentials without dealing with the ticket API.

## REST-based Audits

CAS audit data and logs may now be [POSTed to a REST endpoint](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Audits.html) of your choosing.

## SAML2 Attribute Friendly Names

CAS [acting as a SAML2 identity provider](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html) is given the ability to individually configure friendly names for attributes released to service providers.

## Configuration Binding Behavior

Starting with this release candidate, the configuration binding operations start to be a bit less forgiving when it comes to detecting *unknown* CAS settings found in property sources such as the `cas.properties` file. If you have existing settings that are no longer accepted or recognized, CAS will present you with an error at runtime and on startup forcing you clean up the configuration and find the correct replacements where relevant.

As part of this change, please note that the following settings that deal with CAS standalone configuration resolution have been renamed:

- `cas.standalone.config` to `cas.standalone.configurationDirectory`
- `cas.standalone.config.file` to `cas.standalone.configurationFile`
- `cas.standalone.security` to `cas.standalone.configurationSecurity`

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Beware</strong><br/>This is done to ensure configuration settings recognized by CAS are kept up-to-date, accurate and relevant throughout upgrades. As yet another reminder, it is unnecessary to copy an entire collection of CAS settings and values into property sources without fully knowing their application and impact. Per the usual recommendation, you are to keep the entire overlay construct clean, precise  and laser-focused on behavior you do in fact need.
</div>

## New Command-line Shell Commands

The [CAS command-line shell](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Commandline-Shell.html) is now given the following capabilities:

- Export database schemas and DDLs 
- Generate SAML IdP metadata and related keystores and certificates
- Jasypt-related commands to test available cipher algorithms and providers used to secure CAS properties, thanks to [@hdeadman](https://github.com/hdeadman).

## SAML2 Audits

SAML2 requests and responses accepted and produced by CAS while running as a SAML2 identity provider are now routed to the audit log. As part of this change, the auditing functionality in CAS is slightly improved to allow for dynamic registration of audit action and resource resolution events that may be carried out by any CAS module at runtime and typically on startup.

## Audit Trail Management

Audit record management in CAS is given the abllity to work with multiple managers, storing audit data in many destinations at the same time. The auditing library is also given the ablity to fetch audit data based on a starting date whose value may be controlled in CAS settings.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Beware</strong><br/>As part of this change, a number of settings that specifically controlled the behavior of audit functionality based on log files and Slf4j have changed location, moving over to a <code>slf4j</code> category. Review the documentation for all settings and adjust accordingly if you have included any of those settings in your property sources.
</div>
