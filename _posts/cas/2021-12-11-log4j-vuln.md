# Overview

A new zero-day exploit has been reported against the Log4J2 library which can allow an attacker to remotely execute code. The vulnerability has been reported with [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) against the `log4j-core` jar. This has been fixed in [Log4J v2.16.0](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/logging/log4j/log4j-core/2.16.0/). While updating third-party libraries for patch releases is generally not the project policy, an exception is warranted in this case given the nature of this vulnerability.

CAS security releases are now made available to ensure the Log4J library is upgraded to a more secure version.

For additional details on how security issues, patches and announcements are handled, please read the [Apereo CAS project vulnerability disclosure](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Sec-Vuln-Response.html) process.

# Affected Deployments

The security issue described here, [per the CAS maintenance policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Maintenance-Policy.html), affects the Apereo CAS server for the following versions:

```
- 6.3.x
- 6.4.x
```

If your CAS version is not listed above and is still part of an active maintenance cycle [per the CAS maintenance policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Maintenance-Policy.html), you *might* need to take manual action to ensure the Log4J library is upgraded to a more recent acceptable version. Examine the Log4J library version found in your CAS build to determine its vulnerability status, and then substitute as necessary.

# Severity

See [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228). Also see [this post](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html).

> It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack. Log4j 2.15.0 restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. 

Note that previous mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property <code>log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup</code> to true **do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability**.

# Timeline

The issue was originally reported on December 9th, 2021 and CAS releases were patched on October 10th-11th, 2021 and released. The original patch releases for this issue upgraded relevant CAS versions to Log4J `2.15.0`. In light of [this post](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html), additional patch releases were published on December 15th 2021 to upgrade Log4J to `2.16.0`.
 
# Patching

Patch releases are available to address CAS deployments. Upgrades to the next patch version for each release should be a drop-in replacement.

## Procedure

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note</strong><br/>Patch releases below upgrade the affected Log4J dependency to <code>2.16.0</code>. If you do not wish to upgrade, the safest thing to do is to upgrade Log4J to a safe version, or remove the <code>JndiLookup</code> class from the <code>log4j-core</code> JAR file. Other mitigation measures are <strong>insufficient</strong>.
</div>

### 6.3.x

Modify your CAS overlay to point to the version `6.3.7.3`.

### 6.4.x

Modify your CAS overlay to point to the version `6.4.4.1`.
