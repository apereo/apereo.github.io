# Overview

A new zero-day exploit has been reported against the Log4J2 library which can allow an attacker to remotely execute code. The vulnerability has been reported with [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) against the `log4j-core` jar. This has been fixed in [Log4J v2.16.0](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/logging/log4j/log4j-core/2.16.0/). While updating third-party libraries for patch releases is generally not the project policy, an exception is warranted in this case given the nature of this vulnerability.

CAS security releases are now made available to ensure the Log4J library is upgraded to a more secure version.

For additional details on how security issues, patches and announcements are handled, please read the [Apereo CAS project vulnerability disclosure](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Sec-Vuln-Response.html) process.

# Affected Deployments

The security issue described here, [per the CAS maintenance policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Maintenance-Policy.html), affects the Apereo CAS server for the following versions:

```
- 6.3.x
- 6.4.x
```

If your CAS version is not listed above and is still part of an active maintenance cycle [per the CAS maintenance policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Maintenance-Policy.html), you *might* need to take manual action to ensure the Log4J library is upgraded to a more recent acceptable version. Examine the Log4J library version found in your CAS build to determine its vulnerability status, and then substitute as necessary.

# Severity

See [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228). Also see [this post](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html).

# Timeline

The issue was originally reported on December 9th, 2021 and CAS releases were patched on October 10th-11th, 2021 and released.

# Patching

Patch releases are available to address CAS deployments. Upgrades to the next patch version for each release should be a drop-in replacement.

## Procedure

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note</strong><br/>Patch releases below upgrade the affected Log4J dependency to <code>2.16.0</code>. If you do not wish to upgrade, the safest thing to do is to upgrade Log4J to a safe version, or remove the <code>JndiLookup</code> class from the <code>log4j-core</code> JAR file. Other mitigation measures are <strong>insufficient</strong>.
</div>

### 6.3.x

Modify your CAS overlay to point to the version `6.3.7.3`.

### 6.4.x

Modify your CAS overlay to point to the version `6.4.4.1`.
