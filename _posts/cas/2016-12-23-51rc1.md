The official CAS `5.0.0` GA [was released about 6 weeks ago](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.0.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.1.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the first release candidate in the `5.1.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.1.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy 
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

## Log Levels via CAS Properties

The configuration of CAS logging levels is traditionally done directly inside the `log4j2.xml` file.
As an easier option and thanks to Spring Boot, log levels may also be specified via the normal
CAS properties:

```properties
logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
logging.level.org.apereo.cas=DEBUG
```

## Name Authentication Handlers

Additional CAS properties are exposed for all authentication handlers so
they can individually be named. By default, handler names are set to the name
of the defining Java class. Given the class name might change, it's preferred if each adopter
defines unique/custom names for each scheme.

You generally do NOT have to worry about this behavior at all; It's only relevant if you, for instance,
have defined multifactor authentication bypass rules based on authentication handler names.

## JWS/JWE Compression

CAS ciphers that deal with signing/encryption based on JWEs are now by default configured
to force compression via the `zip` claim.

## Security Filters Enabled by Default

CAS has long had options to enforce a number of request headers to enable XSS/HSTS/etc protection.
These fillters are turned on by default, starting from this release candidate.

## CORS Security Filter

Much like the above option, CAS adds support for enabling a CORS filter
that should help more with CAS enabled applications are accessed via XHR/Ajax requests.
This filter is off by default and needs to be explicitly configured by the adopter.

## Database AuthN BCrypt Encoder

Thanks to community contributions, minor changes are made to the internal CAS authentication API to ensure
password encoding can execute correctly specially when the `BCrypt` encoder is defined.

## Duration as Unit of Measure

Thanks to community contributions, all CAS settings that deal with time units
should start to support the duration syntax for full clarity on unit of measure:

```bash
"PT20S"     -- parses as "20 seconds"
"PT15M"     -- parses as "15 minutes"
"PT10H"     -- parses as "10 hours"
"P2D"       -- parses as "2 days"
"P2DT3H4M"  -- parses as "2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes"
```

## Risk-based Authentication

CAS is able to track and examine authentication requests for suspicious behavior.
Risk-based authentication allows CAS to detect suspicious and seemingly-fraudulent authentication requests 
based on past user behavior and collected authentication events, statistics, etc. 
Once and after primary authentication where the principal is identified, 
the authentication transaction is analyzed via a number of configurable criteria and 
fences to determine how risky the attempt may be. The result of the evaluation step is a 
cumulative risk score that is then weighed against a risk threshold set by the CAS operator. 
In the event that the authentication attempt is considered risky well beyond the risk threshold, 
CAS may be allowed to take action and mitigate that risk.

You can learn more about this feature [here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-RiskBased-Authentication.html).
At this point, the changeset and accompanying modules are fairly experimental and are going through rounds of testing
and patching. If this functionality interests you, by all means give it a trial run and share feedback as much as possible.

## AuthN Events in Audit Log

CAS events are now routed to the CAS audit logs. This allows one,
for instance, to learn when an MFA event is triggered and to note
if MFA was successfully honored and executed:

```bash
=============================================================
WHO: audit:unknown
WHAT: [event=mfa-duo,timestamp=Mon Nov 14 12:01:17 MST 2016,source=RankedAuthenticationProviderWebflowEventResolver]
ACTION: AUTHENTICATION_EVENT_TRIGGERED
APPLICATION: CAS
WHEN: Mon Nov 14 12:01:17 MST 2016
CLIENT IP ADDRESS: 110.5.75.1
SERVER IP ADDRESS: 110.2.75.1
=============================================================
```

## Duo Security Account Checking

Presently, if users are unregistered with Duo Security or allowed through via a direct bypass,
CAS puts the user through multifactor authentication and simply validates the response internally
and somewhat invisibly, allowing the application to receive an authentication context that indicates 
multifactor authentication did actually commence. 

In this release, CAS starts to [query the user account](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/DuoSecurity-Authentication.html)
apriori to learn
whether user is registered or configured for direct bypass. If the account status matches either of those conditions or the
user account is not registered yet the new-user enrollment policy allows folks to skip registration, CAS will bypass
Duo Security altogether and will **NOT** report back a multifactor-enabled authentication context back to the application.

## Duo Security Multiple Configurations *<sup>[1]</sup>*

CAS is now able to support [different configuration blocks](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/DuoSecurity-Authentication.html)
for multiple Duo Security instances:

```properties
# cas.authn.mfa.duo[0].duoSecretKey=
# cas.authn.mfa.duo[0].duoApplicationKey=
# cas.authn.mfa.duo[0].duoIntegrationKey=
# cas.authn.mfa.duo[0].duoApiHost=
# cas.authn.mfa.duo[0].id=mfa-duo
...
# cas.authn.mfa.duo[1].duoSecretKey=
# cas.authn.mfa.duo[1].duoApplicationKey=
# cas.authn.mfa.duo[1].duoIntegrationKey=
# cas.authn.mfa.duo[1].duoApiHost=
# cas.authn.mfa.duo[1].id=mfa-second-duo
...
```

By default, a Duo Security provider in CAS is registered under `mfa-duo`
noted by the above id. However, additional providers can now be registered
with arbitrary identifiers. All MFA triggers shall function exactly as before
and as long as they are configured to produce the right match for the right
provider id, CAS will activate MFA for the Duo Security configuration
that is linked to the selected identifier.

At this point in time, Duo Security is the only provider in CAS
whose configuration can be specified in blocks. However,
[and this turned out to be a VERY non-trivial task], adjustments are made
internally to ensure other providers can be configured in much the same way
should there be demands.

## Embedded Container Version

The embedded container version now shows up in the CAS banner on startup:

```bash
CAS Version: 5.1.0-SNAPSHOT
...
Container Version: Apache Tomcat/8.5.x
```

## Redis Ticket Registry

Thanks to community contributions, CAS gains support for Redis as a storage machenism for its ticket registry backend.
Redis is an open source in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.
You can learn more about the registry behavior via [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Redis-Ticket-Registry.html).

## Code Cleanup and Optimization

Thanks to community contributions, the CAS codebase is revitalized ever more to make sure
most if not all underlying components adhere to proper coding standards and design practices.
Changes in this area include adjustments to style guidelines, constructor-based dependency injections
and navigating from Guava Collections to the native Java 8 Collections/Lambda APIs. 

## Registered Service Legacy Definitions

Thanks to community contributions, CAS' handling of 
[legacy service registry definitions](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/JSON-Service-Management.html)
that are backed by JSON are now slightly improved to preserve backwards compatibility
with prior CAS versions whose service definition was based on the old `org.jasig` namespace.

## LDAP Connection Strategies

Additional configuration options are now made available to allow users to define
a connection strategy of their own choosing, should multiple LDAP urls be specified in the configuration.

## MongoDb Authentication: Password Encoding

Minor bug fix; Improper construction of password encoders caused MongoDb authentication attempts
to reject all user credentials, failing to apply proper hashing/encoding on the password for validation.
This should now be fixed.

## Service Registry Performance

Thanks to community contributions, there have been a number of performance improvement applied
to the way CAS saves, updates and locates services internally. Likewise, improvements are applied
to the way CAS services handle regex pattern matching when responding to requests.

## LDAP Principal Attributes Merged with Attribute Repositories 

LDAP authentication in CAS can be made to directly resolve attributes without involving
external attribute repositories via Person Directory. While simple, this isn't always the use case.
For instance, if there is ever a requirement to additionally resolve attributes from a JDBC source,
the adopter is to abandon attribute resolution directly as part of LDAP authentication and is then
forced to define a separate LDAP attribute repository source alongside a JDBC source
so the final result from both can be merged.

This is now improved such that attributes retrieved as part of LDAP authentication are now
merged with all other attributes retrieved from attribute repository sources, if any.

## Internal Auto Configuration *<sup>[1]</sup>*

CAS 5 took the auto-configuration strategy to the next level, thanks to Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.
The approach was to component-scan the application context under `org.apereo.cas`
and load components and beans that were declared via the housing `@Configuration`s. 

In this release, CAS entirely turns off component scanning and switches to Spring Boot's auto-configure style.
The strategy is more or less the same where `@Configuration` classes still register CAS components as `@Bean`s.
The difference is that each CAS module provides a `spring.factories` file in which configuration
classes and application context initializers are placed. This strategy allows CAS to exactly control
the set of configurations that are loaded very explicitly for each mdule and also helps with deterministic load behavior
where configurations for instance can register themselves to be loaded before or after a particular component
to accommodate runtime behavioral dependencies.

This may partially help with start-up times as well when CAS is run via the embedded container, but so far
tests show that performance more or less remains the same.

Note that while this isn't generally something that the average adopter needs to worry about,
this is nonetheless a breaking change **IIF** you have designed Java components/classes that are auto-scanned under `org.apereo.cas`.
Those will NO LONGER be picked up by CAS automatically and you will need to either manually register them
as CAS does via your own `spring.factories` or set up a auto-scanning configuration
under your own package names via `@ComponentScan`, etc.

## Multiple Attribute Repositories *<sup>[1]</sup>*

Attribute repository sources that are controlled and managed via Person Directory
have now turned into lists. This allows you to create more than one source
if necessary and then have all sources be merged into a single repository
automatically to resolve CAS principals and attributes.

```properties
# cas.authn.attributeRepository.ldap[0].ldapUrl=ldaps://ldap1.example.edu,...
...
# cas.authn.attributeRepository.ldap[1].ldapUrl=ldaps://ldap2.example.edu,...
...
```

## Attribute Repositories Order

You have to consider that when you have more than one attribute repository source
defined, there may be cases where two sources end up colliding as they both may produce
the same attribute. In such cases, CAS already provides capabilities to merge the final
result and take action to either add, replace or ignore subsequent attempts at producing
an attribute, if one already is found and fixed. This becomes important as it directly impacts
the execution order of sources.

For instance, consider that you have sources `S1` and `S2` defined both of which
are configured to produce an attribute `A1`. Policies are configured to note that if `A1`
is already found via one source, no other source should attempt to overwrite it.
The question then really becomes: which source should execute and query for data first?

To handle this, CAS allows you to order attribute repositories.
Those with a lower order execute first and take priority in querying
for attributes:

```properties
# cas.authn.attributeRepository.ldap[0].ldapUrl=ldaps://ldap1.example.edu,...
# cas.authn.attributeRepository.ldap[0].order=1
...
# cas.authn.attributeRepository.ldap[1].ldapUrl=ldaps://ldap2.example.edu,...
# cas.authn.attributeRepository.ldap[1].order=10
...
```

## Service UI Info on Login Screen

In situations where CAS ends up playing proxy behind a protocol
such as SAML2, OAuth or OIDC, the login screen wrongly displayed the
UI metadata (i.e. logo, description, etc) about the proxying (callback) service.
This is now corrected so relevant UI information about the real service/destination
is displayed on the screen per the SAML metadata or the CAS service registry.

## SAML2 ECP

CAS starts to support a rather modest implementation of the SAML2 ECP profile.
At this point, the changeset and accompanying modules are fairly experimental 
and are going through rounds of testing
and patching. If this functionality interests you, by all means give
it a trial run and share feedback as much as possible.


## SAML2 InCommon Metadata

A number of improvements are applied to the way CAS handles the retrieval
and resolution of large SAML metadata files that are downloaded over the web.
The download strategy is now handled over a multi-part multi-threaded connection
which should boost performance and startup times quite a bit.

InCommon SPs are now supported directly via the usual CAS configuration settings, while in the past
adopters expicitly had to register InCommon in the CAS service registry.

## SAML2/OAuth/OIDC Multifactor Authentication

CAS triggers for multifactor authentication have all been reorganized
in much the same way as the above item to ensure that authentication
requests via SAML2, OAuth or OpenID Connect may all go through
multifactor authentication based on the real service and not the proxying (callback) url.

## SAML IdP Metadata Location URI

A trivial bug fix; the location of the metadata for CAS' SAML2 IdP functionality
can now be specified in URI format as well. (i.e. `file://etc/cas/somewhere`)

## Service Registry JSON Auto-Init

Service registries can now take advantage of the auto-initialization feature
in a more direct manner. The previous behavior only populated a given registry
if it was left empty by the adopter. However, in certain cases CAS modules auto-insert
service definitions into the registry and interfere with this auto-initialization
behavior. This is now corrected to ensure the service registry, if permitted,
can forcefully be populated regardless of size while gracefully ignoring
duplicate entries that may already be present.

## Embedded Container HTTP2 Support

The [embedded container](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Servlet-Container.html)
is now configured to automatically upgrade the protocol
and support HTTP2. Note that activation of this feature for an external Apache Tomcat
instance requires Apache Tomcat `8.5.6` or above. 

## Internet2 Grouper MFA Trigger

As an extra option, CAS can now integrate with [Grouper](http://www.internet2.edu/grouper/software.html) 
and use a subject [CAS principal] groups' 
to [learn whether MFA should be triggered](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Multifactor-Authentication.html#triggers).
As an example, you could devise a use case
where all subjects who are assigned to an `mfa-duo` groups may be asked to execute MFA
via Duo Security. If you have deployed Grouper, this may be a much more immediate option
than to pick up changes based on a given principal attribute once after provisioning
has had a chance to process.

## REST API Performance

Thanks to community contributions, improvements have gone into the implementation of
CAS REST APIs to ensure best coding practices are in-place, performance-wise.

## LDAP Validator Configuration

Additional properties are now exposed to allow configuration of LDAP validators
for ALL operations that deal with LDAP functionality. CAS supports
both `SEARCH` and `COMPARE` modes.

## Logging Panel

CAS provides an administrative screen to manage and review logs.
This screen is now improved to allow one to update logger levels immediately
from the UI and observe better CAS diagnostics data.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1205228/20279208/d9e43d12-aa64-11e6-903e-acb559d4882b.png)

Note that at present, changes applied to the configuration UI are only
persisted in memory since the underlying framework does not yet provide a
way to save changes back out to disk, etc. This means, once you restart the
CAS server node all changes applied to logs via the configuration panel are lost.

## Improved Hazelcast Configuration

Minor adjustments are made to the Hazelcast configuration
to stop using deprecated settings for internal eviction policies.

## SAML2 IdP Handling of RelayState

Thanks to community contributions, the SAML2 functionality of CAS
is now able to properly retain the `RelayState` parameter.

## JSON Enhancements to CAS APIs

Thanks to community contributions, CAS APIs are now slightly massaged
to handle JSON serialization of core ticketing components. This is useful
for ticket registry implementations that are based on NoSQL databases such as
Apache Cassandra, which as a [pending pull request](https://github.com/apereo/cas/pull/2111)
may also soon become a first-class CAS ticket registry feature.

## Multifactor Authentication Bypass Per Service

In this release CAS starts to provide options to 
selectively [exclude a set of applications](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Multifactor-Authentication.html#triggers)
from multifactor authentication. This is useful in cases where you have turned on multifactor authentication globally.
A number of other bugs also in this area have been fixed to ensure handler/authentication attribute names
can correctly be defined to bypass multifactor authentication.

## OIDC Delegated AuthN Scope

Having upgraded to early snapshots of Pac4J, additional CAS configurtion options
are now made available to allow for providing `scope` when delegating authentication
to an external OIDC provider.

## LinkedIn Delegated AuthN

Thanks to the early Pac4J upgrade, CAS now starts to support
delegating authentication to LinkedIn in addition to a variety of other social providers.

## Management Webapp Authorization Roles *<sup>[1]</sup>*

The authorization roles for the management webapp and the administrative user interfaces
are now modified to allow distinct roles for access without the need for extra data parsing:

```properties
# cas.adminPagesSecurity.adminRoles[0]=ROLE_ADMIN
...
# cas.mgmt.adminRoles[0]=ROLE_ADMIN
# cas.mgmt.adminRoles[1]=ROLE_SUPER_USER
```

## OIDC Dynamic Client Registration

[OpenId Connect in CAS](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OIDC-Authentication.html)
is now starting to support modest implementations of
the [dynamic client registration](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dyn-reg-management-01)
protocol.

## JWTs as Service Tickets

Starting with this release candidate, CAS gains the ability
to issue [JWTs as service tickets](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/JWT-Authentication.html).
JWTs are entirely self-contained
and include enough information about the authenticated principal
and available claims for given application integration.

## Delegated AuthN Auto Redirect

In the event that you have configured CAS to delegate authentication to
an external [social] identity provider, options are now made available to
automatically redirect the authentication flow to the provider bypassing
the CAS login screen. This option today is only relevant and active
if there is a single provider available.
