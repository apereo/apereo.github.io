The official CAS `5.3.0` GA was released on [June 29th, 2018](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.3.0). Since then, the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release that is tagged as `6.0.0`. Note that this is a **major release** of the CAS software which *may* present significant changes in architecture, configuration or behavior. Please review the [release policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html) to learn more about the scope of the release.

This post intends to highlight some of the improvements and enhancements packed into the **fourth** release candidate in the `6.0.0` series.

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2018/10/26/600rc3-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use
{:.no_toc}

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

In order to start experimenting with release candidates, at any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Overlay

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following setting:

```properties
casVersion=6.0.0-RC4
```

### New & Noteworthy

#### Actuator Endpoint Ids

CAS [actuator endpoints](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Monitoring-Statistics.html) are named to be more consistent with Spring Boot guidelines, to remove startup warnings and prevents errors in future upgrades to Spring Boot `2.2.x`. Previous endpoints that were created using *kebab-case* identifiers such as `spring-webflow` are now switched over to use *camel-case* instead, such as `springWebflow`.

#### SMS via Groovy & REST

[Sending SMS messages](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/SMS-Messaging-Configuration.html) is now also possible via Groovy scripts or a REST API.

#### Dockerized CAS Overlay

The [CAS WAR Overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template) is equipped to build Docker images using `jib`.

#### Command-line Shell

The [CAS Command-line Shell](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Commandline-Shell.html) gets a few upgrades to stay compatible with the most recent changes to the build, as well as a few new commands to generate crypto keys or encrypt/sign data, etc.

#### Service Environments

Each registered application in the registry may be assigned a set of [environment names](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/services/Configuring-Service-Environments.html).

#### reCAPTCHA v3

Support for [reCAPTCHA v3](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Configuring-Google-reCAPTCHA.html) is now added to CAS.

#### Amazon Cognito

CAS is able to leverage [Amazon Cognito](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/AWS-Cognito-Authentication.html) for authentication.

#### JDBC Naming Strategy

Additional options are exposed to help remap database *virtual* table names to logical names either via static settings or Groovy scripts, 
when database schemas and queries are created. This allows one to translate CAS-provided table names to those that might work better 
with older or less forgiving database platforms that have restrictions on naming, etc.

### Small Stuff

- Small number of bug fixes to handle authorization correctly for [delegated authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Delegate-Authentication.html).
- The configuration settings for Spring Cloud configuration modules for MongoDb, DynamoDb, JDBC, etc should properly be recognized by CAS again.
- The background job to reload CAS registered service is made conditional to only execute in case a reloadable storage option is registered.
- A number of additional test cases for AWS S3 functionality.
- Improvements to the crypto algorithm selection used to generate secure random numbers.
- CAS configuration can now be recognized via Groovy closures.
- CAS configuration watch can operate on both the configuration directory and the standalone *direct* configuration file.
- CAS multifactor authentication via RADIUS gains the ability to enforce a limit on the number of allowed authentication attempts.
- Secret keys used for various signing and encryption operations can now properly be recognized via CAS settings.
- SAML2 SLO functionality receives a number of improvements to handle various forms of bindings.
