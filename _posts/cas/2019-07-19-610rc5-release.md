The official CAS `6.0.0` GA was released on [December 28th, 2018](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v6.0.0). Since then, the project has been moving forward with the development of the next feature release that is tagged as `6.1.0`. Please review the [release policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html) to learn more about the scope of the release. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements and enhancements packed into the **fifth** release candidate in the `6.1.0` series.

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2019/06/07/610rc4-release/).

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](https://apereo.github.io/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

### Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

In order to start experimenting with release candidates, at any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

## Overlay

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following setting:

```properties
casVersion=6.1.0-RC5
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>System Requirements</strong><br/>There are no changes to the minimum system/platform requirements for this release.
</div>

## New & Noteworthy

### Redis Authentication

User accounts can now be authenticated against [Redis](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Redis-Authentication.html). Likewise,
the integration is also allowed to fetch attributes from Redis databases without or without authentication against Redis.

### Password History Tracking

[Password Management](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/password_management/Password-Management.html) in CAS
gains the ability to also track password history and prevent recycling old passwords where appropriate.

### Attribute Consent via Redis

Attribute consent decisions can now be tracked and stored inside [Redis](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Release-Consent.html).

### MFA Trusted Devices Bypass

The [multifactor trusted device](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/mfa/Multifactor-TrustedDevice-Authentication.html) gains the ability
to specify bypass options per application.

### Scripted Attribute Value Filters

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
  <strong>Beware</strong><br />This may be a breaking change. Please examine your external scripted attribute value filters to make sure
  the script body matches the structure required by the filter component. You may simply need to write the script around a <code>run</code>
  method with arguments passed as an <code>Object[]</code>.
</div>

[Scripted attribute value filters](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Value-Release-Policies.html) are now pre-compiled
and cached to deliver better performance when it comes to parsing and running Groovy scripts.

Additionally, most if not all scripting functionality is revisited to ensure compiled scripts can be cached as efficiently as possible
to improve execution performance.

### Shared Webapp Resources

Shared web application resources such as configuration files and HTML views are now moved into a separate CAS module `cas-server-webapp-resources`. 
This should not require a change to how the overlay works. If the resources are in a jar then they can still be overridden by resources in the webapp's 
`WEB-INF\classes` folder (i.e. `src\main\resources` of the overlay). This is possible because `WEB-INF\classes` is first in classpath before `WEB-INF\lib*.jar`.

The CAS overlay is also modified to comply with this change, when asked to fetch resources from the exploded CAS web application.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>WATCH OUT!</strong><br/>While we do not anticipate this to be a breaking change for CAS overlays, you do need to make sure
  the overlay is updated to match and include the provided task definitions that recognize the new module.
</div>

### Acceptable Usage Policy via Redis

Acceptable Usage Policy decisions can now tracked and stored inside [Redis](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/webflow/Webflow-Customization-AUP.html).

## Other Stuff

- Cassandra Ticket Registry is improved to take advantage of distinct tables for ticket types per the CAS ticket catalog.
- Principal transformation via Groovy can now detect and load changes to the external Groovy script automatically.
- LDAP search queries can now process paged responses, instructed by CAS configuration, to fully obtain LDAP results from a query.
- Minor fixes to properties and relevant documentation for typos, etc.
- Delegated authentication to SAML2 identity providers gains the ability to specify signed authentication requests, multiple context classes, etc.
