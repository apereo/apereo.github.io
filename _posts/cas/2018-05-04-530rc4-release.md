The official CAS `5.2.0` GA was released on [November 27th, 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.2.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.3.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the **fourth** release candidate in the `5.3.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.3.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2018/03/30/530rc3-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). In order to start experimenting with release candidates, use the following strategies.

At any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Apache Maven

In the `pom.xml` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following tag to match below:

```xml
<cas.version>5.3.0-RC4</cas.version>
```

### Gradle

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-gradle-overlay-template), adjust the following setting to match below:

```properties
cas.version=5.3.0-RC4
```

## Minors

- Thanks to [@leleuj](https://github.com/leleuj), validation of OAuth and OpenID Connect requests gain improvements in terms of protocol compatibility.
- The rendering syntax of CAS attributes in the validation response can now be controlled using CAS settings to enable inline rendering. (i.e. `<cas:attribute name="givenName" value="John"></cas:attribute>`)
- Thanks to [@frett](https://github.com/frett), the initialization of the login webflow is fixed to only execute once.
- Refreshing CAS configuration should allow for re-initialization of the service registry, if CAS is configured to populate the service registry database from JSON service files.
- Thanks to [@NgSekLong](https://github.com/NgSekLong), the validation of the OAuth `client_secret` parameter is made optional if it's left undefined for the OAuth service.
- CAS test coverage has improved slightly with a number of additional tests where now coverage is at 60% and growing.
- Auditing a *password change* operation using the [CAS password management](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Password-Management.html) features is fixed to correctly catalog failures.
- Static analysis is now turned on [CAS CI builds](https://travis-ci.org/apereo/cas/builds) using FindBugs by default as well as Checkstyle. The builds are also taking advantage of the OWASP Dependency Check plugin for Gradle to auto-scan libraries used by CAS and fail the build in case a relevant CVE is found in the CAS distribution.
- Thanks to [@williame-uah](https://github.com/williame-uah), the `encryptionSecretSize` parameter is fixed in CAS command-line shell to remove the duplicate name.
- Handling LDAP account states to process warnings, etc can now be separately turned on via CAS configuration, as part of the password policy settings.
- Thanks to [@tsschmidt](https://github.com/tsschmidt), the strategy for calculating service registry file names can now be customized in a pluggable way. This in particular has a benefit of allowing the management web application to provide customized naming strategies for resources as they are tracked in source control and Git, etc.
- Annotation processing behavior has been restored to account for CAS extensions of Log4j, as well as correctly generating configuration metadata.
- Thanks to [@sbearcsiro](https://github.com/sbearcsiro), a number of bugs that affect Twitter's OAuth1 requests and responses when dealing with delegated authentication in CAS are now fixed.
- Logout management in CAS is modified to be able to internally handle submitting logout notifications to multiple URLs associated with a single application.
- A Groovy implementation is now made available for `PrincipalFactory` objects that may be used inside custom configuration classes in areas where principal resolution needs unusual changes.

## Delegated Authentication & MFA

[Delegating authentication events to ADFS](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/ADFS-Integration.html) as well as [all other external identity providers](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Delegate-Authentication.html) are now revisited to handle multifactor authentication flows better, once the flow travels back from the identity provider to CAS after authentication.

## Password Management Email Notifications

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>WATCH OUT!</strong><br/>This is a breaking change. Review your settings and be sure to adjust.
</div>

Settings that control email notifications for password reset operations are placed under a `mail` setting to be consistent with all other properties. As a result, the email notification operations of password reset gain small improvements to honor CC and BCC flags defined in configuration.

## Passwordless Authentication

An initial draft of [Passwordless Authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Passwordless-Authentication.html) is now available. This is a form of authentication in CAS where passwords take the form of tokens that expire after a configurable period of time, and are sent to users using email, text messages, etc.

## AWS ElastiCache for Memcached

For [memcached integrations](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Memcached-Ticket-Registry.html), CAS is now able to provide a native module that is able to seamlessly integrate with AWS ElastiCache. This is mostly a drop-in replacement for the spymemcached.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>WATCH OUT!</strong><br/>The memcached support modules in CAS no longer take the opinionated approach of presenting a memcached client library. The choices are now presented as separated modules that you are to choose and then stuff into your overlay. If you are unsure what to choose, choose spymemcached.
</div>

## AWS Simple Notification Service for SMS

Support is now included to take advantage of [AWS SNS](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/SMS-Messaging-Configuration.html) for sending SMS messages.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>WATCH OUT!</strong><br/>As par of this change, the configuration of various SMS providers is now moved into a parent <code>cas.smsProviders</code> category. Please review your settings and adjust.
</div>

## AWS Secrets Manager

CAS configuration settings may now be managed and located using [AWS Secrets Manager](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Server-Management.html#spring-cloud).

## RESTful View Resolution

CAS views can now be resolved using an external URL in [RESTful ways](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/User-Interface-Customization-Views.html).

## AWS S3 Buckets

CAS configuration properties can now also be fetched from [AWS S3 buckets](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Server-Management.html#amazon-s3). Similarly, SAML metadata documents for various service providers may also be managed using [AWS S3 buckets](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-DynamicMetadata.html).
