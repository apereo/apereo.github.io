The official CAS `5.0.0` GA was released on [November 7th 2016](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.0.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.1.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the fourth release candidate in the `5.1.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.1.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

If you are looking for additional info on the previous release candidate, [please see this post](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/31/rc3-release/).

<!-- /TOC -->

## SAML2 Service Providers

A few more [SAML2 service providers](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Configuring-SAML-SP-Integrations.html) are added to this release namely Adobe Cloud, AcademicWorks, Infinite Campus, Slack, Gartner, Zendesk and more.

## CAS Demos

CAS demos are neatly organized and deployed on [Heroku](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/#demos).

## Surrogate Authentiction

The ability to authenticate on behalf of another user, so called [Surrogate Authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Surrogate-Authentication.html), is now included
in this release.

## SAML2 NameID Qualifiers

SAML2 service definitions are now allowed the option to override the name qualifiers for a given subject's name id.

## Scripted Attribute Release

Scripted [attribute release policies](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Release-Policies.html) are now able to accept an inlined groovy script as well.

## Distributed Tracing

CAS embraces [Spring Cloud Sleuth](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Monitoring-Statistics.html#distributed-tracing) which implements a distributed tracing solution for Spring Cloud.

## Encrypted Service Usernames

CAS username providers are now able to [encrypt the resolved username](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Release-PrincipalId.html) using the service public key. Applications are expected to decrypt of course using their paired private key.

## Automated Docker Cloud Builds

CAS is now taking advantage of [Docker Cloud's automated builds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/builds/automated-build/)
to auto-publish CAS images for the `latest` and all other relevant tagged releases. 

## Eureka Service Discovery

Thanks to Spring Cloud, CAS provides integration support for [Eureka Service Discovery](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Service-Discovery-Guide.html). 

## Spring Cloud w/ Apache ZooKeeper

More of a documentation enhancement and thanks to community contributions and expertise, the CAS Spring Cloud configuration server is now able to use [Apache ZooKeeper](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Server-Management.html#apache-zookeeper) as the backend storage service to house CAS settings.

## Logging Enhancements

Another documentation improvement, the [CAS logging guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Logging.html) introduces a few new sections to explain logging layouts. There is also some verbiage that describes how to integrate CAS logs with Papertrail.

## Spring Boot Administration Server

Starting with this release, the actuator endpoints provided by Spring Boot can be managed remotely via the [Spring Boot Admin server dashboard](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Monitoring-Administration.html).

## Multifactor EntityID Trigger

In cases where authentication is delegated to CAS most commonly from a [Shibboleth Identity Provider](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Shibboleth.html), the `entityId` is passed to CAS as an extra request parameter to indicate the service provider. In this release, CAS begins to recognize the `entityId` parameter and treat it as a normal `service` that is linked to the CAS service registry which can then be assigned different access strategy and [multifactor authentication policies](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Multifactor-Authentication-Triggers.html).

## Principal ID As Attribute

A small enhancement to CAS [attribute release policies](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Release-Policies.html) where now, the principal id itself can be released as a custom attribute of your own choosing on a per-service basis.

## Groovy Attribute Value Filters

Attribute values for release policies can now [take advantage of Groovy scripts](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Release-Policies.html#groovy) to weed through the released collection dynamically.

## Documentation

Additional docs are now available to explain:

- [How to extend the CAS configuration](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Management-Extensions.html)
- [How to extend the CAS webflow](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Webflow-Customization-Extensions.html)
- [How to design custom triggers for multifactor authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Multifactor-Authentication-Triggers.html#custom)
- [How to design custom authentication strategies](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Custom-Authentication.html)

Additionally, common CAS configuration settings that apply to more than one module are given [their own dedicated space](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Properties-Common.html).

## Minor Changes

A number of small bug fixes and improvements have been incorporated into this feature release:

### Community Contributions

- Acceptable Usage Policy is now able to correctly accept and store user decisions.
- Hazelcast ticket registry is now able to properly decode and find encrypted tickets.

- X509 authentication should correctly route the user back to the login form in cases of authentication failures.
- Google authenticator backed by JDBC should properly create and name databasse tables.
- Minor fixes to OpenID module to ensure views can proper render for ticket validation and other requests.
- Minor fixes to OpenID Connect module to ensure scopes can properly be filtered, and that clients are fully loaded and management via the services management web application.

### Others

- MDC logging is now respecting nullable properties of the HTTP request.
- Authy as a multifactor authentication provider gains the ability to specify the country code for the user phone number.
- MFA flows are now able to correctly handle scenarios where authentication produces warnings.
- OAuth2 `password` grant type is now correctly able to issue user profiles.
- Ticket registry cleaner is no longer scheduled as a no-op if it's disabled in the configuration.

## What's Next?

The development team is working to make sure the CAS `5.1.0` release is
on [schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). This is the last release candidate in the `5.1.x` release and the project will gear up to perform a few more rounds of testing and validation before the official GA release is tagged and made available.
