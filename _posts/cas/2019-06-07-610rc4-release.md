The official CAS `6.0.0` GA was released on [December 28th, 2018](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v6.0.0). Since then, the project has been moving forward with the development of the next feature release that is tagged as `6.1.0`. Please review the [release policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html) to learn more about the scope of the release. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements and enhancements packed into the **fourth** release candidate in the `6.1.0` series.

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2019/04/29/610rc3-release/).

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](https://apereo.github.io/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

### Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

In order to start experimenting with release candidates, at any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

## Overlay

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following setting:

```properties
casVersion=6.1.0-RC4
```

  <strong>System Requirements</strong><br/>There are no changes to the minimum system/platform requirements for this release.

## New & Noteworthy

### Required Services for Single SignOn

CAS may be configured to require the user to authenticate from an application before
access can be granted to all other registered services. [See this](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SSO-Session-Cookie.html) for more info.

### Acceptable Usage Policy Audits

Acceptable Usage Policy choices and results are now passed to the [Audit Log](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Audits.html).

### Jasypt Configuration Security

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>WATCH OUT!</strong><br/>This is a breaking change. You will need to make sure relevant
  configuration values are updated to remain functional.
</div>

Configuration properties secured and encrypted via Jasypt are required to be prefixed with
`{cas-cipher}` instead of `{cipher}` so as to avoid conflicts with Spring Cloud way of encrypting
and decrypting values.

### Multifactor Provider Selection

In the event that more than [multifactor authentication provider](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/mfa/Configuring-Multifactor-Authentication.html) qualifies to satisfy the authentication request, CAS may be configured to present a choice and menu to the user 
where one would interactively pick the provider that works best at a given time. This mode is off by default, and complements existing
selection strategies that are based on ranking strategies and weights or custom logic implemented in Groovy scripts, etc.

### Jasypt Encryption with CAS Commandline Shell

A new `decrypt-value` command is added to [CAS Commandline Shell](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Commandline-Shell.html) to verify encrypted values.

### SAML2 Skew Allowance per Service

SAML2 registered services can now define a `skew-allowance` value in seconds used to skew dates in the final response, such as valid-from, issue-instant, etc.

### Registered Services Actuator Endpoint

The `registeredServices` actuator endpoint gains a `DELETE` operation to remove registered services from CAS.

### Acceptto Multifactor Integration

[Acceptto](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/mfa/AuthyAuthenticator-Authentication.html) is now supported
as a CAS multifactor authentication provider.

### Java 12 Compatibility

Though not required, CAS is able to build and run successfully against the latest versions of JDK 12.

### Graal Compiler Compatibility

Additional tests are carried out to ensure CAS can remain functional while running with the Graal Compiler.
If you'd like to experiment with this to gain possible performance improvements, start your CAS deployment with
the following VM options: `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+EnableJVMCI -XX:+UseJVMCICompiler`

### Dependency Updates via Renovate

The process of updating CAS dependencies is somewhat automated through Travis CI, taking advantage
of the [renovate bot](https://github.com/renovatebot).

### SAML2 Encryption Configuration per Service

CAS, running as a [SAML2 identity provider](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html#name-id-selection), gains a few extra settings to control and override the encryption configuration of objects on a per service provider. Services can also be tagged to consider encryption as optional in case compatible keys are not found in the service provider metadata.

### OpenID Connect Dynamic Registration

Many incremental improvements to support OpenID Connect dynamic registration of RPs with richer metadata
in the registration request, such as handling of `policy_uri`, `tos_uri`, `logo_uri`, etc.

### SAML2 Signing Configuration per Service

CAS, running as a [SAML2 identity provider](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html#name-id-selection), gains a few extra settings to control and override the signing configuration of objects on a per service provider. Additional documentation improvements are also
available in this space to provide more examples for signing configuration, name id selection, etc.

### CAS Docker Deployments

In addition to the `jib` plugin built into the CAS overlay to produce docker images, 
the [CAS Docker project](https://github.com/apereo/cas-webapp-docker) is also updated to provide
a standalone `Dockerfile` based on CAS `6`. It's likely that this project would eventually get merged with
the main CAS overlay to ensure all configuration options and deployment strategies are found in one spot
and used per one's preference.

## Other Stuff

- Assigning identifiers to registered services is modified to not produce negative numeric ids.
- Password policy warning messages should now be recognized by Memcached and the Kryo serialization engine.
- Trivial fix to CAS commandline shell ensure the runtime can recognize CAS configuration settings internally. 

## Library Upgrades

- OpenSAML
- JavaParser
- Oshi
- Ribbon
